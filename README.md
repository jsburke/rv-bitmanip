# BitManip Overview

This project is a build up to implement the proposed RISC-V X-BitManip extension.  From a high level, the goal is to incorporate these into Piccolo and Flute with a RISCV_BBox similar to how the M extension is handled via the RISCV_MBox.  The modules contained herein may have varying degrees of optimization.  In addition to this, this repo will provide standalone tests to verify proper execution of each instruction in bluespec verilog by producing test BRAMs.
